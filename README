The current dataset includes the fMRI data from 57 participants who watched a shortened version of The Sixth Sense movie (~60 minutes) and recalled the movie scenes (both parts were scanned). There were 3 conditions. In one group, participants learned about the twist at the beginning of the movie (“spoiled group”, condition = 1 in subj_info.txt fie). The second group watched the movie and the twist came at the end of the movie (“twist group”, condition = 2 in subj_info.txt fie). The third group watched the movie but did not watch the twist at the end of the movie and did the recall naive to the twist information (“no twist group”, condition = 3 in subj_info.txt fie).

Events files show when stimulus (each event) begins relative to the beginning of the scan file. In 6 participants the recall was paused and resumed. In these participants each recall file is linked to one section of the recall and has its own event file. Note the order of the files in subj_info.txt fie (recall part 1, part 2, etc). Scans were stopped manually and so each file has different TR size. This does not affect the analysis. TR numbers of each functional file is included in its file name. 

scene_info.txt includes some information about the content of each scene. For the definition of “critical scenes”, please see the paper.
